# Codecademy Transitions - 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\

Added animations to an existing static web page. The web page is an online reader; it presents the full text of the book “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” by Jules Verne.

The page for the first chapter is mostly complete. There are a few fancy features:

- When you hover over the sidebar on the left, a menu opens which contains the Table of Contents.
- When you hover over a highlighted word in the text, a definition appears. See the words “phosphorescent” and “locomotion”.
- When you hover over the semi-transparent buttons at the bottom of the page, they turn opaque.
- When you hover over any link, it changes color.
